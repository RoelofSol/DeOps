
mark unconfirmed


---------------------

bottom line not painted over
themed scroll bar (scrollbar renderer?)
tree lines sometimes arent painted correctly
scroll/zoom should have end buttons with mouse over states
	plus minus button uses 7 increment
	
---------

outlook change to schedule - currently outlook system not enforcing sense of community, but individualism
	items should guide subordinates, other programs can handle personal schedule
	
cant not show unconfirmed because local may be linked to an unconfirmed



--- notes ---

jobs are used because the word conveys a more long term and permanent meaning

people can take an assigned job and break it up into tasks based on how 'they' want it done
	this serves to prevent micromanagement as different people achive the same goals in different ways
	
why not my personal schedule?
	there are programs for that, outlook, etc.. the schedule in de-ops gives focus to all subordinates
	of what the current mission is
	
unconfirmed access to plan?
	if a whole branch becomes sub to a node but is not confirmed it could be 'leeching'
	need to foster confirmation into hierarchy before plan is devulged
