
what is the process I want to patent?
	System and method of distributed bottom-up command and control
	
	bottom-up is the keyword I need to differentiate from other systems

	system upon which services can be built on top of that are inherently secure (mail, IM, storage)

	split communication system that allows simultaneous communication between higher and lower levels while maintaining security
	
	data objects in system
		signed
		respect hierarchy
		cached at close peers
		inheritable, mail, im, chat, location, plans
		
	users control their own polocies and who access data objects

	No admin, admin-less, client/server distinction
	
	a platform upon which services can be built that inheret decentralization, security, persistance features
