

Goals --------------------------
Goal is to mimic organizational structure within the org
Create sense of transparency
Large scale coordination system allows people to arrange themselves into a hierarchial structure
100, 1000, 10000, calable
usually would require large IT support, and static structure, servers for mail, files, etc..
DeOps is inherently secure with trust relationships

Decentralized ----------------------
Equal member every node, same security as everyone, homogeneous, inherently secure
Fast easy setup network, no security, no servers no IT, no problems..
Aids in synchronization, backing up data, means reliability and fault tolerance
Dynamic, can change shape and function on the fly
As changes take place security is 100% retained

Hierarchy -------------------------
Allows strong links between each other and hence lines that connect everyone
Alternate hierarchial strucutres achieving the goal of a function/project matrix within the organization

Comm ------------
IM
Chat hi/low
Mail, send persistant send files
Board, public forum per node, post reply

Planning ------------------------
Calander / Log, bi-directional history of progress
Todo

Pro / Std differences
compartmentalization vs total transparency
flexible enc vs fixed on enc
$$ vs free
extra components, voice, cam, etc..

Storage ----------
Common file system - common repository of files across the whole network, changes happen along hierarchial lines up-approved, down-update

Datebase ------
Component with the most potential
