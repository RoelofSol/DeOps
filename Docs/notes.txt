
debugging
	finding an error
		start removing code
	chaning an implementation / structure
		re-name old strucutures to *old
		create mirror stuctures
		start moving old implementation over to the new 
	
	Length of the data to decrypt is invalid.
		Happens when FileStream is used to read TaggedStream data
	
performance	
	128 clients, 10 sim minutes, no services loaded, fresh start, avg memory, logging off
		debug < 400mb, 80mb after GC
		max 500kb bandwidth, < 1kb/s
		with chat, each connection 150kb overhead so 128 * 16 max per untrusted room * 150kb = 300mb!
	
Threading
	Op objects are recreated when loaded so that interface with current handle doesnt get collections modified inbetween
		dont need to lock inside op stucture if only interface accesses it
		when someone is editing/wring a new opPlan and a new plan gets loaded there wont be a conflict

single instance
	scenario user part of multiple public networks, or surfing public networks quickly
	global network remains established across all, only one global net
	prevent global net connection for each instance of riseOp
	will all loaded cores managed by single instance, bandwidth can be managed more efficiently

security
	level 1 - operation key
	level 2 - secure routing (only routing to trust linked nodes)
	level 3 - compartmentalization
	level 4 - p2p comm links
	
LAN
	lan mode on default on startup
	
	if lan mode on
		broadcast ping in lan mode every 20 secs (disconnect / reconnect find each other quickly)
		ping telling us our IP is external sets lan mode false
			set firewall to blocked - dont need to disconnect
		
	if lan mode off
		receiving tcp connects or pings from LAN ips, has no effect on firewall
		on disconnect from operation
			reset IP
			set LAN mode on
			broadcast ping
			set firewall blocked - dont need to disconnect tcp, already disconnected

	receive ping
		if local ip
			if lan mode store
			if not lan mode ignore
		if external ip
			if lan mode - set lan mode off, set blocked, purge routing, store localIP as LanIP
			if not lan mode - store in routing, set firewall
			
	set broadcast port to first 2 bytes of opkey's hash


	
chat
	pure p2p everyone connected to everyone else, rudp should have low overhead 100bytes/min max, 100 users would be 1,000/6 bps
