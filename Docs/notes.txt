performance	
	128 clients, 10 sim minutes, no services loaded, fresh start, avg memory, logging off
		debug < 400mb, 80mb after GC

Threading
	Op objects are recreated when loaded so that interface with current handle doesnt get collections modified inbetween
		dont need to lock inside op stucture if only interface accesses it
		when someone is editing/wring a new opPlan and a new plan gets loaded there wont be a conflict
