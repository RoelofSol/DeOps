
debugging
	finding an error
		start removing code
	chaning an implementation / structure
		re-name old strucutures to *old
		create mirror stuctures
		start moving old implementation over to the new 
	
	Length of the data to decrypt is invalid.
		Happens when FileStream is used to read TaggedStream data
	
performance	
	128 clients, 10 sim minutes, no services loaded, fresh start, avg memory, logging off
		debug < 400mb, 80mb after GC
		max 500kb bandwidth, < 1kb/s
		with chat, each connection 150kb overhead so 128 * 16 max per untrusted room * 150kb = 300mb!
	
Threading
	Op objects are recreated when loaded so that interface with current handle doesnt get collections modified inbetween
		dont need to lock inside op stucture if only interface accesses it
		when someone is editing/wring a new opPlan and a new plan gets loaded there wont be a conflict

security
	level 1 - operation key
	level 2 - secure routing (only routing to trust linked nodes)
	level 3 - compartmentalization
	level 4 - p2p comm links
	
chat
	pure p2p everyone connected to everyone else, rudp should have low overhead 100bytes/min max, 100 users would be 1,000/6 bps
