
add accept change to storageInfo interface for folders - so name / ghost status is transferred over easily
download status not updating, check changes to storageupdate in view, test with big file

downloads getting stalled, onmoredata not being called on upload side, send_request not being sent on download side

integration

	Auto-Integrate (id)
		For each file/folder uid
			If file/folder not flagged as modified
				Set current file to our latest
				from self to highest
					if current is integrated (files only)
						set current file to higher's latest
						break
					for each file/folder in higher's archive
						if itemdiff is same and date is equal or newer than now
							set current file to higher's latest
							break
						else
							break
							
				if current file/folder is not our own (itemdiff)
					Call update function which
						replace our current with this new file
						if unlocked, overwrites
						replace should also use this function
						merges integration list for nodes adjacent to ourselves
						
					only 'save' if file system in a saved state
						still merge with unsaved file system, just won't be made permanent till save is clicked
						
	RefreshHigherChanges(id)
		remove current cached entries
		for each uid
				cache archive archive files newer than current file
				cache latest integrated file from node on path to ourselves
				if uid does not exist
					check all uids to see if dupe exists with diff uid (itemdiff)
					if exists, replace our uid, with higher's uid
					else if name conflict create locally, remame local .old.
					else create locally
					
	on link update
		remove all cache enties
		load higher nodes
	
	cache header
		forech project
			if header is higher or equal to self
				RefreshCacheEntries
				if not startup
					run auto-integrate
			
	on startup
		run auto-integrate (really needs to be multi-threaded)

	why
		this method lets branches work on their own projects without highers of higher's changes overwrite local stufff
		enforces  integration chain leading up to top
		if middle higher offline, can still inherit files that middle higher never touched
		always in sync with files that local doesnt work with, but higher changes
		red triangle will be reserved for real conflicts



		
review file references system
how does add/replace work with unlocked files - figure out when doing inheritance
check if file / dir has same name when renaming / creating in storage system	
after hash if file modified, and hash is equal to unmodified, remove modified flag
double click open local temp files/*folders
carry over notes whe`` accepting changes, edit notes box needs to be larger, convert \n to <br>
show failed diffs
get working with how visual studio does saves, crazy rename / delete / create process
support multiple select - right click download
on app close - remove all storage folders, especially for users that are not us
use path class to check for invalid characters
drag move file to diff dir, carry history, leave ghost


test creating temp files / dirs
test re-name file propagation	

if hashes
	clicking apply / integrate asks user to perform that action



change archive to ghosts (pacman logo) - ghosts are files that were either deleted or moved, they serve as markers for others to use
		when syncronizing their file system to yours
		delete permanently if no history exists of file
		ghost folders white folders with black outlines and eyes!
	
visibility - who / levels down (these 2 settings replace higher / lower direct etc..)
	on regional link change do visibility check of local files to see if they still conform, ghost them
		restored / created - file visible with-in x sub-levels of <user>
		file only visible with-in x sub-levels of <user>

drag / drop - in/out, across folders
remote - download, unlock, open, re-lock
save/discard persist over open / close?


storage tasks
	find transparent folder icon - pull from a dll somewhere, both normal and open
	delete folder that is selected - clear file view
	drag/drop moving between folders, more testing
	changes / save labels not even, zoom in and align
	click on icon should select as well
	default page in web interface (total files size/count) / unlocked count
	show folders pane if there are sub folders from root
	test multi-project file system
	if system empty, nothing selected display 'drag file in to add to system' - root folder shows default instructions

	make note on interface if local file (hash) not present in storage system, like encryption error of some sort causes it to not be placed
		blue if pending processing, if failed, turn back to grey
	test locking / unlocking big files, determine if progress bar or notification of some sort needed, maybe queue them like hashing
	trigger to lock all unlocked on guiclose
	test periodic saves of working / and verify load from working file works
	on close, hang if still hash processing
	support multi-file/folder operations
	sorting of listview
	open folder icon in folder tree
	folders have red / blue dots in center if subfolders contains changes
	
	
	
	
plans
	old plans not being deleted? seems like extra files in dir, try loading solo and updating local plan file
	shutdown in the middle of the causing load corruption?			
	***move saving estimates to savelocal

		
let text input control acceptTabs for composeMain and postForm, remove smilies

crits 
look at replacing common code with delegates

nat/block keep list of recent search ids/kadids so duplicate results arent sent out
check natted are finding closest nodes to proxy off of

use rudp when available to transmit link / loc data
with rudp now being used, should analyze purely global network

alpha release
	xeno code
	calling home w/ version num
	expiration


search revisions
	give components priority?? link over location, etc..
	make sure search result locations get to file download
	make sure store locations get to file download direct search -> store response works through firewalls
	both have the ability to be proxied

	record source kaddi with value
	on download try source, id isnt in location list, search for it, need that ID key to connect

	by the time key gets checked for download, profile / link headers should have right key if source is the same, if not gotta search

	search/download priority high (view) normal (network) low (research)
	forward searches to proxies
	if blocked send acks tcp to be forwarded
	analyze contact info sent in acks
	ensure correct contact info gets to transfer control, if blocked/natted/open ensure all work
	make sure download isnt started without sources

	search results need to transfer location info over to downloader
	what does search result from firewalled host look like?
	search results seem to only go out udp
	
	**location info should include array of latest versions of each component
		so local area can update for everyone on login to the network
		storage, plans, profile - need latest fetched data of local area
		location data needs to be stored when user is offline for this to work

now
	re-publishing mail
	permanent locations, no ttl except for global
	locking of resources, lay out flow


test
	more accurate replication - link/location/profile/mail
	check that data is cachced 8 closest to ID, record cached link files in sim interface
	links timing out when traversing strucuture
	maxes / focus purging for all components - links/locs/profiles/mail
	link.getlocs / getlocsbelow
	link/plan research timer

Core
    moe de-ops source
    
    old projects not cleared from components during savelocal, save / ditch / option?
     
	Rudp
		location updates
		route data over session if desination the same	
		
	Location Control
		global replication
		make persistant so status panel can display last seen, also loaded can go straight to the cache
		might be problem with different client ids

	IM Control
		Saved/Loaded my main IM interface
		Internal interface
		Log Interface - in chat log
		If link is unknown, then name is unkown, make sure to search for name and update interface
		4 node network, running, send IM caused collection modified error in im_view:displaylog
		
	Chat Control
		Custom rooms
		dont mention disconnect unless connection was made, also in IM
		log does chat/im - setup like yahoo chat log
		
	Mail Control
	    debug send/recv mail
		tagging messages, filter by tags
		add user link that pops up encapsulated link chooser control (LinkPanel), 
			does queries, receives updates, etc.. (put in add task win also)
		double clicking on name loacates them in link tree in panel
		use labels for organization - for example a project label could be tagged on, so we could filter regarding project x
		
	Board Control
		Archiving, attaching files
	
	Profile
		Search / Transfer process painfully slow in real time mode, analyze
		project specific motds use divs/javascript to show / hide?


Interface

	Internal 
		expand a little more (names associated with sessions/transfers/searches/publish)

	Link
		sometimes on link changes, cannot select confirm link even though node is pending

	Profile
		time out loading
		seperate interface for MOTD editing, grey out in normal profile editor
			MOTD packets seperate, flagged with ProjectID

	operation list toolbar: select, link(dropdown), IM, Mail (quick stuff)

	Invite 
		password protected invite file
		invite contains singed, who invited
		Keep deops.net file with as many ips as possible on load
		delete invite file when new user created
	
	Groups on buddy list
		Locals
		Tabs, etc.. so permanent tabs can be kept on people, grey if offline
		
	Graphics
		right click, drop down menus, component
		  storage  - drive
		  profile  - license
		  mail     - mailbox
		  board    - post it
		  chat     - chat bubble
		  goals    - dart
		  schedule -

	ticker
		link update, board, mail, plan, online,
		scroller higher level broadcast
		on open scroll - welcome to de-ops 1.023, and pending assignments mails, status of systems
			after that only scroll when stuff happens
		click - display list (log) of all recent messages
		black with red/blue/grey text depending on level of message
		

Simulator
	add collection test to simulator by randomly accessing de-op collections in seperate sim thread
	record max udp burst sizes, or do packet size distribution histogram


search
	index components in local area of dht network
	search - sends query to that area of network target is in
	

quick
	test with null global, even have option for secret at this point?
	ensure callers know what to do when tcpcontrol.sendpacket is overloaded
	bandwidth chart
	subclass collections, create auto locked collections
	use localfilekey for all file names so name diff per computer
	IM/Chat right click font view, right click timestamp view
	finish self search and then start bucket replication so startup doesnt spit out massive patches
	component dir also encoded with local key / trimmed to 8 chars
	interface 
		treeview ex not using themed +/- / scrollbars
		listbox header resize doesn't stop when col 0 is width 0
		listbox/tree not full size when no border is active
	Selecting people for task/mail should be drop down combo add/remove (add pops up link panel dialog so exact choice can be made) [prevent name forging]
	cache files missing from component header - do in load header
			dont delete old path in Cache<component> function, until new header saved: move - save headers - delete old files
	run save headers every 10 secs - every sec is too often, and slows simmy
			
Future
	notification area of changes in all components, click brings user to change, or can discard
	Nodes that say they proxy for node x have signed auth from x
	Ping includes auth test for id
    variable internal / private key schemes and sizes, ECC
    linear contact merging / split system?
    5 connections in same op but all blocked able to form active op network by proxying throgh global
    customizable logo/icons
    good leadership/management guide
    web based problem simulation, people assigned roles, sim starts, try to solve, katrina sim ;)
    database to storage system (for use with bug trackers, inventories, etc..)
    network determined time that emails / messages are tagged with to prevent one computers off clock from screwing crap up
		intergrate with location component
    detect when computer changes then prompt user for location string update
    project/op name and other settings should be taken from whoever is the root node of self, info in projectdata
    quota storage space per node, interface to show, per component storage req as well as over all memory auditing interface
    implementing help button on all dialogs
    lock read/write individually, let multiple reads go at same time
    voice chat in rooms / IM using skype API - can get to land lines
    whiteboard
    load goal/board/mail archives serperately to speed load / reduce memory usage
    
    security
		able to change Op ID in client - for project forks or if project is majorly compramised
			new Op ID can be secure mailed to entire org, or pointer can be put in link file (went to op id x)
			
		signed invitation files - so that if bad people get in, we know who signed them in
    
    store caching 
		used when high load
		how to keep cache entries up to date?
		cache entries only last for like 5 mins
		requester do theh caching, or should requested auto-cache if load too high
			auto-caching might not hit the nodes that requesting nodes would be likely to hit

	udp packet throttle **** especially for patches
		backlog for packets, for patches, etc.. not for rudp
		packet cache for more than 4k sent in second
		cache should go for 60 seconds make, 240k, bleed cache out, first in first out
		Alert if packet cache has any entries at all
		check in sim if node sending more than x packets per sec
		
Compartmentalization
	sign with level key, mark with level version of key signed
	when link version updated
		if subordinates removed
			create new level key
			level version set to current link file version
		encrypt and sign level key with each of the sub ordinates key
	compartmentalized data is encrypted with level key
	only sub-ordinates at the time of specific objects compartmentalization have access to level
	board - post contains reply key to simplify many needed level keys
	level key for high / low
	
	branch compart
		branch key encoded with level key
		lower links encode higher branch keys with their level key to lowers
		branch version same as level?
		
	'set permissions dialog' that all components can implement, user can click 'permissions..' button to set
	
Release security
    throwing load exception in obfuscated code?
	Ensure unnessesary strings arent exposed
	Online tracking, embedd JMG internal key
	Obfuscate
	Sign
	detatch simulator
	Install app into GAC, strong name
	Pre-compile with ngen, http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/default.aspx?pull=/msdnmag/issues/06/05/CLRInsideOut/default.aspx
	send out random garbage and random times to random hosts, sometimes with char stings like 'hola como estas' just to mess
	    sniffers up a lil more 

website
	wiki based
	hire international people, in charge of translation / international sites
		give commission of revenue for sales
	go international ASAP, domestic market is a bear, international is more receptive of new tech like this
	
Pro
	Commercial use
	Security improvements
	Mobile version
	Voice/video chat, try to make it as polished as possible like full screen meeting  interface
	Server Mode
	Signed.. something.. (email?) that is authenticated by others and adds value
		PRO image in upper left of blue bar if user has signed auth key from meee
	Private / Secret Projects
	Flash drive with program and encrypted file system on it, truely portable personal computer
	Lock instance in sentiant mode, required login to activate interface, but underneath still working, acting as server for files
	Single file storage
	Auto language translation - use little drop down flags on left hand side project bar
	componentized, pro version lets you set visibility(up/down) on files/messages, free version everything is transparent
	

link navigation
	path - /project/name/component - smart filling in along the way

	home would go to /fusion/Myself/Profile
	project ex - /fusion/project/myself/links

	fusion://main -> links
	fusion://project -> links
	fusion://project/name -> available component list
	fusion://project/name/component -> component
	
	or
		top buttons only for self
		double click doesnt change focused user
		can only view other node's views by right clicking on them
		switching projects, switches main view to that project
		no project selection in individual component interface
