
now
	38 crits
	simulation refinement, figure out locking needs
	focus on starting up new networks
	refactor components, get ready for visual/database plus think about 3rd party components
	network demo, customization, performance tuning

Testing
	more accurate replication - link/location/profile/mail
	check that data is cachced 8 closest to ID, record cached link files in sim interface
	links timing out when traversing strucuture
	maxes / focus purging for all components - links/locs/profiles/mail
	link.getlocs / getlocsbelow
	link/plan research timer
	

Interface
	General
		Sorting of listviews
		status panel needs to update as network connects network_statusupdate, trigger news as well
		test gmt visible in status panel
		
	Internal 
		expand a little more (names associated with sessions/transfers/searches/publish)
		browsing using nav bar needs to trigger searches and let link control know of whats focused
		create function to search through externals for type/id/project, when popping external look for existing window?

	Link
		sometimes on link changes, cannot select confirm link even though node is pending
		encapsulate common link functions in link control, prevent other controls from directly using linkmap
		Online - Show as currently online nodes structured into makeshift hierarchy
			chat/voice uses this hierarchy for high/low - done so that realtime communication is not fragmented when people go offline
		
	Invite 
		password protected invite file
		invite contains singed, who invited
		Keep deops.net file with as many ips as possible on load
		delete invite file when new user created
	
	News
		crazy refreshes when news not visible and button clicked
		show connected / disconnected
		chat msg (if chat not visible or visited in last minute, or alerted in last minute)
			<project> Chat activityk, Betty: hey group....
		new people online 
		
		more refined, if care about user, do detailed diff between new and old file
			show self only if local didn't make the change, if non-local self change show as white
			detect diff between changed schedule / changed goals or both

	graphics
		storage - restore
		mail	- forward, reply
		board   - high, low, all
		***plans - new, edit, now
		goals	- edit
		tray	- restore, exit
		chat	- online (shinny green circle)
		link    - icons should be chain with arrow pointing in direction of link
	
Components
	General
		Refactor Components with delegates or something, refactor while building visual component
			invokeInterface control->gui, gui->interface control functions handle locking of objects (NO locking from gui code)
		break control into interface comm / control comm so that multiple guis (mobile/mono/wpf) can be implemented easily
		Many actions in gui isnt piped down into control to fire events back to the interface to signal updates for multiple interface instances
		component plug-ins / view plugins for private components
		Remove references to LinkMap, use GetLink
		when component handles exit, assert that all events are emptied of references to debug gui's not releasing event handles
		
	Link
		hide script errors
		only update tree when updated link's parent is different
		keep selection between refreshes
	
		on link update
			clear link's uplinks and uplink's downlinks of the link being updated
			if the project roots contains the link remove it
			if the project roots contains a trust loop that has the link as a downlink, remove the loop
				set loop status of all nodes in loop to false
			
			set link's uplinks, and place pointers in uplink's downlinks
				create temps if needed
			if uplinks for project is none, put in root
			if uplink leads back to self, create trust loop with all uplinks as downlinks
				set all loop status to true for nodes in loop
				remove all nodes in loop from project roots
	
		interface
			if link update is a visible node, or if uplink is visible with subs expanded
				freeze tree control updating
					save visible
					save selected
				refresh tree root nodes
				expand top levels
				expand until previous visibles are visible
				re-select node
				unfreeze tree
	
			clicking on loop node itself shows order of loop
	
		operations
			uplinks - contains all nodes in loop
			downlinks - excludes nodes in loop
			adjacent - if in loop then none
			give/take back/accept trust
			check that uplink/confirm/request operations can all be performed
				warn user when operation will create a loop
			
		components
			plans - inherit plans from highers in loop
			goals - can be assigned in lowers of any branch
			board - higher (uplinks), lower (downlinks)
			chat - high level chat is others in loop
			profile - show motd by all those in loop, uplinks
			storage - auto-inherit from uplinks
			links - getlocs/ishigher/islower, prevent looping to self
		
			
		test linking up to a subordinate works correctly - 2 areas commented out
		allow anyone to trust anyone else
		prevent loops by before traversing to downlink, ensure it is not an uplink as well
		what happens when there are no roots?
		trust loop
			get uplinks - traverse until null, or node reached that is already an uplink id
			details in math notebook
			when link loaded in cache link, after it is reset
				uplinks are traversed, and if cycle is detected, node is flagged as such
				trust loop node created and added to project roots

	Location 
		global replication
		make persistant so status panel can display last seen, also loaded can go straight to the cache
		permanent locations, no ttl except for global
		might be problem with different client ids
		send direct connects location updates immediately so they get things like away messages
		
		location info should probably contain latest versions for all components so 
			for example two of the same account would sync their storage without having to specifically having to open storage
			dynamic works for all components in list
	
	IM 
		Saved/Loaded my main IM interface
		Internal interface
		Log Interface - in chat log
		If link is unknown, then name is unkown, make sure to search for name and update interface
			reflect name changes in IM window / rest of interface
		Crash on close IM, fin being called? unhooking from IMcontrol events? 
		
	Chat 
		Custom rooms - 
			public room, unique ID, anyone can invite anyone else
			pure p2p everyone connected to everyone else, rudp should have low overhead 100bytes/min max, 100 users would be 1,000/6 bps
			use chat pings to ensure connections are in same room
				if chat ping received and not in room respond with leave msg
				if ping received without signed invite, ask for it
			works same as other chats, people we're connected to are black, join/parts shown the same way
			invite contains ids of other users in chat, when leaving ids and all that saved in id list
			private requires signed key in invitation that members can verify with each other
			put invitations in toolbar, show messagebox for first invitation, afterwards ignore if already in toolbar
		
		log does chat/im - setup like yahoo chat log
		if unlinked join default chatroom with other unlinked nodes, without subs
		on join chat, node asks other nodes for previous singed messages before specified time
		
	Mail 
	    debug send/recv mail
		tagging messages, filter by tags
		double clicking on name loacates them in link tree in panel
		use labels for organization - for example a project label could be tagged on, so we could filter regarding project x
		delete mail not refreshing view
		soon - sync local mail between users
		test/do re-publishing mail

	Board 
		 board scope sub-levels down, auto search highers for posts that have source==target, and show if in scope
		 attaching files
		 posts/replies not updating quickly or at all :(
	
	Profile
		time out loading - better searching interface use smoke color and better font, more info searching/dling/etc..
		Search / Transfer process painfully slow in real time mode, analyze

	Plans
		old plans not being deleted? seems like extra files in dir, try loading solo and updating local plan file
		shutdown in the middle of the causing load corruption?			
		transfer branch path when goal <-> schedule
		probably want a custom renderer for the progress bar, default xp has it green

	Storage
		drag into secure storage gives user option to replace what is already there, either on disk or locked
		
		review file references system
		drag files folder over highlights target
		secure copy / paste can use same folder commands as drag/drop

		$ save storage snapshots (past header file versions) - display at root node	
		$ signal on comparison page if all files are replicated on network (can go offline and files still exist)
		
	Search
		index components in local area of dht network
		search - sends query to that area of network target is in	

Core
    old projects not cleared from components during savelocal, save / ditch / option?
    multisource downloading
    each component's minute action should have unique interrupt given by core class
     
	Rudp
		location updates
		route data over session if desination the same	
		nat/block keep list of recent search ids/kadids so duplicate results arent sent out
		check natted are finding closest nodes to proxy off of
		use rudp when available to transmit link / loc data
		with rudp now being used, should analyze purely global network


	Search 
		give components priority?? link over location, etc..
		make sure search result locations get to file download
		make sure store locations get to file download direct search -> store response works through firewalls
		both have the ability to be proxied

		record source kaddi with value
		on download try source, id isnt in location list, search for it, need that ID key to connect

		by the time key gets checked for download, profile / link headers should have right key if source is the same, if not gotta search

		search/download priority high (view) normal (network) low (research)
		forward searches to proxies
		if blocked send acks tcp to be forwarded
		analyze contact info sent in acks
		ensure correct contact info gets to transfer control, if blocked/natted/open ensure all work
		make sure download isnt started without sources

		search results need to transfer location info over to downloader
		what does search result from firewalled host look like?
		search results seem to only go out udp
		
		location info should include array of latest versions of each component
			so local area can update for everyone on login to the network
			storage, plans, profile - need latest fetched data of local area
			location data needs to be stored when user is offline for this to work

	store caching 
		used when high load
		how to keep cache entries up to date?
		cache entries only last for like 5 mins
		requester do theh caching, or should requested auto-cache if load too high
			auto-caching might not hit the nodes that requesting nodes would be likely to hit
		index file hashes on network for files over 10 meg, otherwise file can be multisourced from default replicators of file

	udp packet throttle especially for patches
		backlog for packets, for patches, etc.. not for rudp
		packet cache for more than 4k sent in second
		cache should go for 60 seconds make, 240k, bleed cache out, first in first out
		Alert if packet cache has any entries at all
		check in sim if node sending more than x packets per sec
		
	ensure small nets / starting nets can be proxied through global net
		tcp proxies for non-local ops should be bandwidth throttled
		connect status should specify proxied through global
		5 connections in same op but all blocked able to form active op network by proxying throgh global
		
	privacy from untrusted
		mail grey if from untrusted source
		no posts allowed from untrusted
		IM settings allow host to not allow messages from untrusted
		refuse replication of network pieces to blacklisted, inherit blacklist from higher
			dont not replicate to untrusted because then each id needs to be trust verified continually
		heartbeat from top down with unique key, wont talk to 'unknown' nodes in dht without it
		
Simulator
	track bandwidth / memory / allocated objects
	figure out why IO writes in FiresoftDemo so high, getting 2min/sec through, pretty damn good
	record max udp burst sizes, or do packet size distribution histogram

	test lockreading inside writing and visa versa
		
	run full speed, min/max components with updates, try to get conflicts
	run 30 clients, track mem/client, time/client, more sim control in interface

	checksigned / idtokey throw exceptions, maybe just return false or something?
	
			
quick
	test with null global, even have option for secret at this point?
	ensure callers know what to do when tcpcontrol.sendpacket is overloaded
	bandwidth chart
	subclass collections, create auto locked collections
	use localfilekey for all file names so name diff per computer
	finish self search and then start bucket replication so startup doesnt spit out massive patches
	component dir also encoded with local key / trimmed to 8 chars
	cache files missing from component header - do in load header
			dont delete old path in Cache<component> function, until new header saved: move - save headers - delete old files
	run save headers every 10 secs - every sec is too often, and slows simmy
			
			
Future
	Nodes that say they proxy for node x have signed auth from x
	Ping includes auth test for id
    variable internal / private key schemes and sizes, ECC
    linear contact merging / split system?
    customizable logo/icons/password reqs (length, numerics, case)
    good leadership/management guide
    web based problem simulation, people assigned roles, sim starts, try to solve, katrina sim ;)
    database to storage system (for use with bug trackers, inventories, etc..)
    network determined time that emails / messages are tagged with to prevent one computers off clock from screwing crap up
		intergrate with location component
    detect when computer changes then prompt user for location string update
    project/op name and other settings should be taken from whoever is the root node of self, info in projectdata
    quota storage space per node, interface to show, per component storage req as well as over all memory auditing interface
    implementing help button on all dialogs
    lock read/write individually, let multiple reads go at same time
    voice chat in rooms / IM using skype API - can get to land lines
    load goal/board/mail archives serperately to speed load / reduce memory usage
    put all strings in resource file, mass convert using google translate, let user on run choose flag/language from upper left corner
		autodetect lang on OS as well
    
	de-ops urls boards storages chats anything, extendable
		peoples emails, profiles, etc.. can include <links>

    security
		able to change Op ID in client - for project forks or if project is majorly compramised
			new Op ID can be secure mailed to entire org, or pointer can be put in link file (went to op id x)
			
		signed invitation files - so that if bad people get in, we know who signed them in
	
		periodic heart beat with secuity key sent from to all trusted nodes, key transmitted during all ops
			keeps untrusted from being sent any storage information, if kicked out of trusted tree		
		
	web based node
		server like caching if enabled
		web node is owned by an individual, like any other node	
		web interface, at first just caching support
		
	huge part of project is allowing companies to sell licensense (applications) throughout network
		subs auto inherit purchased apps, never be anywhere without apps, look at encryption techniques to make this work

	components
		visual 
			user can inherit or create new canvases
			default background is transparent so overlays easy
			zoom in/out infinite, images created on 'planes' z-axis coordinate
				zooming out if other regions in view, their sub-regions are found
				affiliate zoom with levels down so that people know on what level to draw
			node inherits higher's images which overlay lower's drawings
				ie higher can create bounds that lower fills in
			node can define regions for lowers to draw in
				lowers by default see this region when they open visuals not the whole canvas
			interface - basic paint operations with copy/paste, show transparent zones (off by default)
			layers for putting down map img/ people img and being able to edit it easily
			3d component uses imported models from any souce, sketch up ? 
			lower corner box shows zoomed out view
			samples - geographical area, flow chart, blueprints
		
		database 
			holder of database can create dashboards, custom views into data for highers ups to understand
			lowers to aggregate data, example - call center statistics, support database with issues
			nodes post sql commands to database, sort of like mail, send, receive, ack, once processed into db
			db entries peer reviewed at host (holder of db), db's can be replicated and hosted somewhere else, exported, imported
			sql express backend? should work on phones as well
		
		audio 
			headphones/speakers, left side is lowers, right side is higher/adjacents	
				on mono prefix high/low beep before audio clip to signal what level talker is from
				save last x voice messages received for playback
			push to talk attached to each ear (or on pda), for talking to higher/lower side
			fastest human to human comunication possilbe, questions go as far up and then down as they need to go instantaneously
			if people are off line, or voice is off, voice network auto-configurse to fill in missing links
				higher node turns into who up the tree is online
				helps people who don't know each other get to know each other
					leads to eventual re-organization as those never on  are re-arranged into lower positions
				everyone on the network is connected through high/low to someone else by voice
				also used for chat
				another reason is that it presueds people to make well structured orgs, not base  a structure
					on what would have people around to talk to (lots of downlinks)
					with this setup for voice/chat there is always a group in range for real-time comm
			
		stats 
			how many people in org, follow link tree
			% active in last x, crawl persistant locs
			balance of tree at diff levels, also could do graphical reresentation
				like sequoia view showing where most people are and who follows them
			security, show all ips and resolve their hosts

		portal 
			links 2 organizatinos between a single point of trust
			portal manaages information flow
			how would something like a credit card work?
				i trust credit company
				business trusts credit company
				portal process credit transaction?
		
		commendations
			people want to be acknowledged/rewarded for progress
			commendation is a signed/and issued by someone to someone else for anything
				dated, details, image
			good canidate for an opensource plugin
				
		
		security
			keeps dns resolved list of online contacts
			can crawl network, list all dns

	Compartmentalization
		sign with level key, mark with level version of key signed
		when link version updated
			if subordinates removed
				create new level key
				level version set to current link file version
			encrypt and sign level key with each of the sub ordinates key
		compartmentalized data is encrypted with level key
		only sub-ordinates at the time of specific objects compartmentalization have access to level
		board - post contains reply key to simplify many needed level keys
		level key for high / low
		
		branch compart
			branch key encoded with level key
			lower links encode higher branch keys with their level key to lowers
			branch version same as level?
			
		'set permissions dialog' that all components can implement, user can click 'permissions..' button to set
		
Release security
    throwing load exception in obfuscated code?
	Ensure unnessesary strings arent exposed
	Online tracking, embedd JMG internal key
	Obfuscate
	Sign
	detatch simulator
	Install app into GAC, strong name
	Pre-compile with ngen, http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/default.aspx?pull=/msdnmag/issues/06/05/CLRInsideOut/default.aspx
	send out random garbage and random times to random hosts, sometimes with char stings like 'hola como estas' just to mess
	    sniffers up a lil more
