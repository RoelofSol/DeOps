
now
	cut down storage todo
	43 crits

Testing
	more accurate replication - link/location/profile/mail
	check that data is cachced 8 closest to ID, record cached link files in sim interface
	links timing out when traversing strucuture
	maxes / focus purging for all components - links/locs/profiles/mail
	link.getlocs / getlocsbelow
	link/plan research timer
	

Interface
	General
		Sorting of listviews
		
	Internal 
		expand a little more (names associated with sessions/transfers/searches/publish)
		browsing using nav bar needs to trigger searches and let link control know of whats focused
		create function to search through externals for type/id/project, when popping external look for existing window?

	Link
		Change text from 'Link' to 'Trust'? More understandable
		sometimes on link changes, cannot select confirm link even though node is pending
		encapsulate common link functions in link control, prevent other controls from directly using linkmap

		only bold tree item for selected dhtid AND project
		changing person focus perserves view
		changing project focus perserves view
		perserve view going from collapse to restore

	Invite 
		password protected invite file
		invite contains singed, who invited
		Keep deops.net file with as many ips as possible on load
		delete invite file when new user created
	
	Groups on buddy list
		Locals
		Tabs, etc.. so permanent tabs can be kept on people, grey if offline

	News
		crazy refreshes when news not visible and button clicked
		show connected / disconnected
		chat msg (if chat not visible or visited in last minute, or alerted in last minute)
		new people online 
		
		more refined, if care about user, do detailed diff between new and old file
			show self only if local didn't make the change, if non-local self change show as white
			detect diff between changed schedule / changed goals or both

	graphics
		storage - add, restore
		mail	- forward, reply
		board   - high, low, all
		plans	- edit
		goals	- edit
		tray	- restore, exit
	
	
Components
	General
		Refactor Components with delegates or something, refactor while building visual component
		break control into interface comm / control comm so that multiple guis (mobile/mono/wpf) can be implemented easily
		Many actions in gui isnt piped down into control to fire events back to the interface to signal updates for multiple interface instances
		component plug-ins / view plugins for private components
		
	Location 
		global replication
		make persistant so status panel can display last seen, also loaded can go straight to the cache
		permanent locations, no ttl except for global
		might be problem with different client ids
		
		location info should probably contain latest versions for all components so 
			for example two of the same account would sync their storage without having to specifically having to open storage
			dynamic works for all components in list
	
	IM 
		Saved/Loaded my main IM interface
		Internal interface
		Log Interface - in chat log
		If link is unknown, then name is unkown, make sure to search for name and update interface
		4 node network, running, send IM caused collection modified error in im_view:displaylog
		remove dupe system messages
		IM/Chat right click font view, right click timestamp view
		
	Chat 
		Custom rooms - priave requires signed key, public key kept in chat file, can be queried for and found over network 
		dont mention disconnect unless connection was made, also in IM
		log does chat/im - setup like yahoo chat log
		
	Mail 
	    debug send/recv mail
		tagging messages, filter by tags
		add user link that pops up encapsulated link chooser control (LinkPanel), 
			does queries, receives updates, etc.. (put in add task win also)
		double clicking on name loacates them in link tree in panel
		use labels for organization - for example a project label could be tagged on, so we could filter regarding project x
		delete mail not refreshing view
		sync local mail between users
		test/do re-publishing mail

	Board 
		 attaching files
	
	Profile
		time out loading
		Search / Transfer process painfully slow in real time mode, analyze

	Plans
		old plans not being deleted? seems like extra files in dir, try loading solo and updating local plan file
		shutdown in the middle of the causing load corruption?			

		Goals 
			star self, blue triangle lower, red triangle higher
			details visible 
			save branch path when transfering goal <-> schedule

	Storage
		
		drag files folder over highlights
		secure copy / paste can use same folder commands as drag/drop
		drag into secure storage gives user option to replace what is already there
		
		test locking /unlocking individual history and remote changes/integrated items
		make note on interface if local file (hash) not present in storage system, like encryption error of some sort causes it to not be placed
			blue if pending processing, if failed, turn back to grey
		test locking / unlocking big files, determine if progress bar or notification of some sort needed, maybe queue them like hashing
		trigger to lock all unlocked on guiclose
		test periodic saves of working / and verify load from working file works
		on close, hang if still hash processing
		
		folders have red / blue dots in center if subfolders contains changes
			recurse mark folders up with a reference count, at 0 remove mark ;)
		
		review file references system
		how does add/replace work with unlocked files - figure out when doing inheritance
		check if file / dir has same name when renaming / creating in storage system	
		after hash if file modified, and hash is equal to unmodified, remove modified flag
		double click open local temp files/*folders
		carry over notes whe`` accepting changes, edit notes box needs to be larger, convert \n to <br>
		get working with how visual studio does saves, crazy rename / delete / create process
		on app close - remove all storage folders, especially for users that are not us
		use path class to check for invalid characters
		
		add accept change to storageInfo interface for folders - so name / ghost status is transferred over easily
		delete folder, changes saying restored, but shouldn't be there because our timestamp is the newest

		remote id view - download, unlock, open, re-lock
	 	save/discard persist over open / close?
		if hashes - clicking apply / integrate asks user to perform that action

		visibility - who / levels down (these 2 settings replace higher / lower direct etc..)
			on regional link change do visibility check of local files to see if they still conform, ghost them
				restored / created - file visible with-in x sub-levels of <user>
				file only visible with-in x sub-levels of <user>
						
		$ save storage snapshots (past header file versions) - display at root node	
		$ signal on comparison page if all files are replicated on network (can go offline and files still exist)
		
	Search
		index components in local area of dht network
		search - sends query to that area of network target is in	

Core
    old projects not cleared from components during savelocal, save / ditch / option?
    multisource downloading
     
	Rudp
		location updates
		route data over session if desination the same	
		nat/block keep list of recent search ids/kadids so duplicate results arent sent out
		check natted are finding closest nodes to proxy off of
		use rudp when available to transmit link / loc data
		with rudp now being used, should analyze purely global network


	Search 
		give components priority?? link over location, etc..
		make sure search result locations get to file download
		make sure store locations get to file download direct search -> store response works through firewalls
		both have the ability to be proxied

		record source kaddi with value
		on download try source, id isnt in location list, search for it, need that ID key to connect

		by the time key gets checked for download, profile / link headers should have right key if source is the same, if not gotta search

		search/download priority high (view) normal (network) low (research)
		forward searches to proxies
		if blocked send acks tcp to be forwarded
		analyze contact info sent in acks
		ensure correct contact info gets to transfer control, if blocked/natted/open ensure all work
		make sure download isnt started without sources

		search results need to transfer location info over to downloader
		what does search result from firewalled host look like?
		search results seem to only go out udp
		
		**location info should include array of latest versions of each component
			so local area can update for everyone on login to the network
			storage, plans, profile - need latest fetched data of local area
			location data needs to be stored when user is offline for this to work

	store caching 
		used when high load
		how to keep cache entries up to date?
		cache entries only last for like 5 mins
		requester do theh caching, or should requested auto-cache if load too high
			auto-caching might not hit the nodes that requesting nodes would be likely to hit

	udp packet throttle **** especially for patches
		backlog for packets, for patches, etc.. not for rudp
		packet cache for more than 4k sent in second
		cache should go for 60 seconds make, 240k, bleed cache out, first in first out
		Alert if packet cache has any entries at all
		check in sim if node sending more than x packets per sec
		
		
Simulator
	add collection test to simulator by randomly accessing de-op collections in seperate sim thread
	record max udp burst sizes, or do packet size distribution histogram

	desynch timer from packets, diff thread
		timer asyncronously run so main interface thread not affected
		also diff thread in simulator, so that cross thread problems are debugged
		main interface thread 1, socket packets thread 2, timer thread 3, run all fast ensure locking etc.. 

	locking of resources, lay out flow
	
	
quick
	test with null global, even have option for secret at this point?
	ensure callers know what to do when tcpcontrol.sendpacket is overloaded
	bandwidth chart
	subclass collections, create auto locked collections
	use localfilekey for all file names so name diff per computer
	finish self search and then start bucket replication so startup doesnt spit out massive patches
	component dir also encoded with local key / trimmed to 8 chars
	cache files missing from component header - do in load header
			dont delete old path in Cache<component> function, until new header saved: move - save headers - delete old files
	run save headers every 10 secs - every sec is too often, and slows simmy
			
			
Future
	Nodes that say they proxy for node x have signed auth from x
	Ping includes auth test for id
    variable internal / private key schemes and sizes, ECC
    linear contact merging / split system?
    5 connections in same op but all blocked able to form active op network by proxying throgh global
    customizable logo/icons/password reqs (length, numerics, case)
    good leadership/management guide
    web based problem simulation, people assigned roles, sim starts, try to solve, katrina sim ;)
    database to storage system (for use with bug trackers, inventories, etc..)
    network determined time that emails / messages are tagged with to prevent one computers off clock from screwing crap up
		intergrate with location component
    detect when computer changes then prompt user for location string update
    project/op name and other settings should be taken from whoever is the root node of self, info in projectdata
    quota storage space per node, interface to show, per component storage req as well as over all memory auditing interface
    implementing help button on all dialogs
    lock read/write individually, let multiple reads go at same time
    voice chat in rooms / IM using skype API - can get to land lines
    load goal/board/mail archives serperately to speed load / reduce memory usage
    
	de-ops urls boards storages chats anything, extendable
		peoples emails, profiles, etc.. can include <links>

    security
		able to change Op ID in client - for project forks or if project is majorly compramised
			new Op ID can be secure mailed to entire org, or pointer can be put in link file (went to op id x)
			
		signed invitation files - so that if bad people get in, we know who signed them in
		
	web based node
		server like caching if enabled
		web node is owned by an individual, like any other node	
		web interface, at first just caching support
		
	huge part of project is allowing companies to sell licensense (applications) throughout network
		subs auto inherit purchased apps, never be anywhere without apps, look at encryption techniques to make this work


	visual component
		user can inherit or create new canvases
		default background is transparent so overlays easy
		zoom in/out infinite, images created on 'planes' z-axis coordinate
			zooming out if other regions in view, their sub-regions are found
			affiliate zoom with levels down so that people know on what level to draw
		node inherits higher's images which overlay lower's drawings
			ie higher can create bounds that lower fills in
		node can define regions for lowers to draw in
			lowers by default see this region when they open visuals not the whole canvas
		interface - basic paint operations with copy/paste, show transparent zones (off by default)
		layers for putting down map img/ people img and being able to edit it easily
		3d component uses imported models from any souce, sketch up ? 
		lower corner box shows zoomed out view
		
	stats component
		how many people in org, follow link tree
		% active in last x, crawl persistant locs
		balance of tree at diff levels, also could do graphical reresentation
			like sequoia view showing where most people are and who follows them

	portal component
		links 2 organizatinos between a single point of trust
		portal manaages information flow
		how would something like a credit card work?
			i trust credit company
			business trusts credit company
			portal process credit transaction?

	Compartmentalization
		sign with level key, mark with level version of key signed
		when link version updated
			if subordinates removed
				create new level key
				level version set to current link file version
			encrypt and sign level key with each of the sub ordinates key
		compartmentalized data is encrypted with level key
		only sub-ordinates at the time of specific objects compartmentalization have access to level
		board - post contains reply key to simplify many needed level keys
		level key for high / low
		
		branch compart
			branch key encoded with level key
			lower links encode higher branch keys with their level key to lowers
			branch version same as level?
			
		'set permissions dialog' that all components can implement, user can click 'permissions..' button to set
		
Release security
    throwing load exception in obfuscated code?
	Ensure unnessesary strings arent exposed
	Online tracking, embedd JMG internal key
	Obfuscate
	Sign
	detatch simulator
	Install app into GAC, strong name
	Pre-compile with ngen, http://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/default.aspx?pull=/msdnmag/issues/06/05/CLRInsideOut/default.aspx
	send out random garbage and random times to random hosts, sometimes with char stings like 'hola como estas' just to mess
	    sniffers up a lil more
