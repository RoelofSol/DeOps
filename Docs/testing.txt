		2 blocked hosts on op1, 1 open hsot on op2
		2 dupe blocked hosts on op1, proxying through same open global node on op2
		2 blocked hosts on op1, 2 open hosts on op2
		full network 5 op1 blocked, 5 op2 open, op1 functional?
		global proxy location entries expire once node connects to real network
		2 global proxied online then open comes online, ensure all nodes set useGlobalProxies to false
		2 blocked connected to 1 open on op, and open node disconnecting, blocked should global proxy

future - automated test system
	automation script - load x hosts, type, timeouts, run, stop, pause, check status, etc..
	maybe a a list<testScenario> that is run through, results / warnings kept for each, can be run individually
