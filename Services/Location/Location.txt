local invisible option - publishes offline, and doesnt reply to pings

		quick look at live comm
			login search for highest that is online
			create a persistant connection with them
			keep tabs on higher's higher as well
			**heart beats flow down periodically from top to bottom of live comm
			people always know the current live comm structure
			dont need to worry about highers getting flooded in loc component
			signed location notify is the 'heart beat'
		
		
	
old location scheme
	every 3 mins node publishes loc info on network
	peers keep their buddy lists alive by searching the network before location data expires
	goal was to prevent someone with 1,000,000 buddies from being flooded off the network - their loc was replicated
	resulted in too much continual researching
			
			
new scheme


	timer
		ping those interested in when timeout reached
		timeout expired interested
		update localInterested
		if loc not local or remote interested - remove
		
	send ping
		latest remote loc version
		
	receive ping
		put node on interested list
		calc timeout
		send notification 
		
		
	send notify
		with loc info if required, and timeout
		signed location with UTC time embedded and version #
		
	receive notification
		update node as being on/offline
		
	on address change
		send notification to those interested
		ping naturally sent will auto-include new loc info
		re-publish new version of location info
		
	going offline
		send notifactions to all those interested
		
	remote offline
		recive notify dead
		or, send ping and no notify reply - do a search
		** if network not established, pause adding/removing
		
	loc list <routing id>
		bool remoteInterested - we sent notifications to
		bool localInterested - we send pings to
		
		int lastLocalVersionSent - send pings with loc info if out of date (not signed)
		
	replicate
		auto replicate to new closer nodes. or not, save bandwidth, wait till situated on network
		
	notes
		tags, local services updated another reason to run notification
		search mechanism stays, but used as last resort
		
		remote interested is dict<routing, timeout> if nodes in remote interested, notifications sent through lightcomm
			on recv end, ping timeouts reset
	
	local interest
		loc service provides hook, asks services who are we interested in
		trust component returns local region, 2 up, 2 down, revise l8r
		chat returns those in rooms
		buddies component returns buddies
		
		when person in tree list view is clicked (main interface only) check online is called
			sets local interest, but probably removed on next pass that queries components
		
		those who have lost interest are not pinged, kept in cache but oldest pushed off after 64
		
		trust view - click
			asks location service FindOnline(userID), set interest is temporary
			if loc is good return true
			if loc out of date, pinged
			if unknown searched
			once found it is pinged, not pinged after that, only if transfer view renews interest (manually)
		
		services should tell loc who they're interested in
		when pruning needs to happen, loc asks them for updated list
		
	inteface
		in person info, show online/offline/searching - research option
		with green/red led graphic
