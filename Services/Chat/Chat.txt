	room would be always desynched, endless support questions
	would  only allow nearest 16 xor/high/low nodes
	generates many location queries on startup of potential untrusted nodes
	special handles needed for those who wish to chat with untrusted who are not
	untrusted can create public rooms anyways
	uses a lot of bw/memory for udp connections for a flurry of unreliability
