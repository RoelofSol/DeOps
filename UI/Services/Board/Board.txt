keep list of active targets (windows open)
keep list of cached targets in scope
	list of dictionaries postid -> header
	
when scope changes, load / unload boards
when window goes active, load / unload boards

keep 50 closest loaded plus open window targets
post targets 64 - prune after
headers per target - 32 prune after

50 boards 25 posts per = 1250
entry target sender project post = 24 bytes
worst case patch would be 32k
